We as a team have come up with a set of operating procedures to contribute to Defy.city to
make all of us efficient and productive at every commit. These are processes that worked
great yesterday and might not be the best solution for today or tomorrow, in that case please
provide suggestions to the contributing guidelines in a pull request.

### Ground rules & expectations
- Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):
- Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects,
which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince
them that your way is correct.
- Open Source Guides are released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its
terms.
- If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to
address them before we can merge your contribution.
- When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your
employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

### Step-by-step guidelines to contribute
- If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.
- If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, open a pull request.
