# Shared-Services
Defy.city is an end-to-end open source mobility framework. Transportation/mobility as a service (TaaS/Maas) has been at the forefront in last couple of years and growing exponentially everyday.All product/service companies are forced to start from scratch and build all the software components, for their ecosystem, by building nearly same/similar pieces over-and-over again.  Most of the existing projects/companies in the TaaS/MaaS space are closed doors with no visibility whatsover to their software ecosystem. Defy.city is a comprehensive ecosystem of frameworks, services, modules, libraries and community that lets developers kickstart a mobility platform in couple-of-clicks and push the limits of existing ecosystem by building state-of-the-art functionalities .  Defy.city was originally started by Pravaig and maintained by list of companies in the space to provide easy software access to masses. 


## Why is it important

- Reduce cost of development: Cost to user increases as every company is building from scratch and reinventing the wheel.
- Reduce cost to end-user:  Present middle-men plaforms charge up-to 50% as the service fees which leads to higher cost to user and lower earnings for asset owner/drivers/delivery agents. Democratizing the ecosystem will help many more platforms to spin-up, reducing the overall cost of services. 
- Reduce time to development: As the industry has started working on sustainable mobility in last couple of years. It is super important for the renewable industry to develop fast so we reduce our carbon footprints as soon as possible. 
- Overall ecosystem: Think about a world where if you wanted to start a software project, every-time you started with building an operating system or a new programming language. That would be painful. The end-goal of the FOSS project is to elevate the entire ecosystem and building products/services that are completely new and unheard of. The best use of your time as a developer/company is to work on building new things and not re-inventing the wheel.
